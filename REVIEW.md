## Review TASK-001 - APPROVED, HELD (ported automation fix from the Meal Prep app)
branch: task-001
verdict: approved (red-zone, held for human `/merge`)

### Context
This app and the Meal Prep app (a sibling project, same developer, same AI Dev OS template) share an
identical `tools/Dispatch-Commands.ps1` / `tools/Run-Codex-Build.ps1` -- confirmed byte-for-byte via
direct comparison before this change. The Meal Prep app hit a real incident: a rework retry silently
left a security fix unapplied, and a crashed re-review then left the task permanently stuck in a way
its own status message claimed was self-healing. That app fixed it as TASK-032/DECISIONS D-051. Since
the underlying code here was identical, the same bug was latent in this project too, just not yet
triggered.

### Findings
**1. No-op-build guard — correct.** `Run-Codex-Build.ps1`'s new `$hasEvidence` check requires
`CHANGELOG.md` or `TEST_REPORT.md` to appear in `$changed` before a build reaching `status: review` is
allowed to auto-chain into review — a general enforcement of AGENTS.md's own mandated evidence steps,
not special-cased to rework retries.

**2. Shared classifier — correct, including the HELD-vs-APPROVED fix.** Consolidating the inline
APPROVED/REWORK/else classification into `Resolve-ReviewOutcome` carries over the fix for a real,
previously-undetected bug: the old inline check would have matched the literal word "APPROVED" inside
a red-zone "APPROVED but HELD" message and incorrectly marked that task `done` on `main` even though
`main NOT changed` is explicit in that same message. Now checked and routed to `status: approved`
first.

**3. Crashed-review handling — correct.** Matches Run-Claude-Review.ps1's own documented intent (a
bare engine failure "stays `status: review`... a valid 'try me again' state") by mirroring that state
onto `main` instead of overwriting it to `blocked` with an unmatched note, with no strike cap since
this is transient infra flakiness, not a task defect.

**4. Pending-review-resume step — correct placement and gating.** Added before "plan once"/"idle
audit", with the build loop gated on `-not $built` so it never double-spends the one-mission-per-`/go`
budget.

**5. Verification — independent, not just copied.** Both files parse clean. `Resolve-ReviewOutcome`
verified via a fixture harness built against THIS repo's own extracted copy of the function (not
assumed correct from the source fix) — 5 cases / 9 assertions, all pass, including the two hardest
(HELD-not-done, strike-increment-from-existing-note). No live end-to-end run (would require a real
crashed `claude -p`/`codex exec` process) — honestly disclosed as unverified in TEST_REPORT.md.

### Verdict
Gate picked: `approved` (red-zone: touches `tools/Dispatch-Commands.ps1` and
`tools/Run-Codex-Build.ps1` directly — the AI Dev OS itself, explicitly listed as red-zone in this
project's own Risk-gated merge rules). Same disclosed same-session caveat as the Meal Prep app's
TASK-014/016/031/032 precedent (Claude both built and reviewed this specific diff) — mitigated by the
independent fixture verification rather than a second read of the same code.

→ TASK-001 status set to `approved` in TASKS.md. Land with `/merge TASK-001` then
`/merge TASK-001 yes`.
