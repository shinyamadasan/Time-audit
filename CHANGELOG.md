# ChronaSense — Changelog

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-09
### Added
- Pomodoro focus mode (25/5 default, adjustable work/break durations)
- Auto-logs work session on pomodoro completion
- Session dots showing completed pomodoros
- Deep work progress bar in focus mode
- Editable task input in focus mode (instead of showing today's intention)
- Current task label shown above timer when running
- Editable timeline entries — tap any entry to edit time, activity, energy

### Fixed
- Switch task button now skips "Still on" — opens form pre-filled with current task
- Focus mode "Switch task" calls correct function (no more duplicate log)
- Two timers conflicting when main timer + pomodoro both running
- End early break button broken (endBreak name collision with pomodoro)
- Untracked blocks removed — gap detection handles missed pings instead
- "YOU SAID" bar removed from ping modal (redundant with "Still on" button)
- Sync pill removed from header (always synced when signed in)

### Changed
- Week view day tabs redesigned to two-row layout with actual dates
- Elapsed time on ping modal shows actual block time, not hardcoded interval

### Renamed
- App renamed from "Time Audit" to "ChronaSense"
- New icon applied to all Android densities + splash screens
